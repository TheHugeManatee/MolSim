# input file for assignment 2
# first line specifies number of particles, being zero in this case
# after that line there should be as many lines; each defining one particle

# after that, some arrays of particles
# WARNING: it is important that the explicit  
# syntax for cuboid arrays:
#
# cuboid x1 x2 x3 v1 v2 v3 m t bMean nx1 nx2 nx3 h
#
# x = bottom left corner
# v = initial velocity
# m = mass
# t = type of the particle
# bMean = brownian motion factor
# nX1, nX2, nX3 = number of particles in the corresponding dimension
# h = distance of the particles
