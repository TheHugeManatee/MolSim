# input file for assignment 2
# first line specifies # of hardcoded particles, being zero
# after that, some arrays of particles
# syntax for cuboid arrays:
#
# cuboid x1 x2 x3 v1 v2 v3 m bMean nx1 nx2 nx3 h
#
# x = bottom left corner
# v = initial velocity
# m = mass
# bMean = brownian motion factor
# nX1, nX2, nX3 = number of particles in the corresponding dimension
# h = distance of the particles
